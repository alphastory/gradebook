#EmberJS Exercise

1. Don’t spend much more than a half-day total on it

2. Use Ember.js, but not use Ember CLI (that would be cool)

###Programming Exercise

1. Use the MV* Javascript framework (in this case useEmber.js) to implement a page that satisfies the user story below.

2. Submit a zip file containing the solution.

###User Story

As a teacher, I want to enter a list of student names along with his or her test score on a page, so I may see a summary of my class’ performance on a test.

The summary shall include the min, max, and average grade.

###Acceptance Criteria

1. The list shall support CRUD operations on student names and his or her associated grade.

2. The list shall support in-line editing of student names and grades, such that changing a test score and pressing enter (or clicking away from the input field) updates the model.

3. Statistics shall automatically update after CRUD operations are performed

4. The list shall validate user input

5. Students in the list with a grade < 65 shall be highlighted to indicate a failing grade

###Guidance

1. The use of server-side technology (i.e. ASP.NET, Node.js, etc.) is not required, but you are free to use it.

2. You may use any mechanism that seems reasonable to preserve state (i.e. browser local storage, or a restful service), if your solution requires it.

3. The simplest solution that gets the job done is fine, including mocking up a persistent data store.

    - **Don’t overthink / overcomplicate it.**


4. You may use any additional Javascript libraries (e.g. Underscore, JQuery, etc), not mandated by the framework that are helpful.
